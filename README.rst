Z-Rad
=====

This is an in-house implementation of radiomics software from University Hospital Zurich. Feature definition standardization according to image biomarker standardisation initiative (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07003).

Installation
------------

Current version of Z-Rad supports Python 3.6-3.8. All releases are tested in Windows 10 and MacOS. Z-Rad may work on Linux but it was not tested on such systems. The legacy version of Z-Rad supporting Python 2.7 is available in **python2** branch.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

- joblib
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- pydicom
- pywavelets
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- tqdm
- vtk
- wxpython
- xlsxwriter


Installing Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Probably the easiest way to install Python 3 is from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/. **Important**: Please download the 64-bit version, otherwise Z-Rad may crash when calculating large structures.

Installing Python packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**With admin rights:**::

    conda install <package-name>

**Without admin rights:**

Due to access right restrictions from USZ site, installation is possible either using compiled binary wheels or via ``pip`` through a proxy.

1. **Wheel**: Download the packages from the Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ and then go to the directory where the wheel was downloaded. Use the following command to install them::

    pip install <name_of_the_wheel.whl>

2. **PIP through a proxy**: Create *pip.ini* file in ``%APPDATA%\pip\pip.ini`` with the following contents::

    [global]
    proxy = http://username:password@proxy.usz.ch:8080
    trusted-host = pypi.python.org
                   pypi.org
                   files.pythonhosted.org

   This configuration file routes the network traffic related to ``pip``. Do not forget to change *username* and *password* to your credentials.
